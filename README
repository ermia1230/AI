REQUIREMENTS:
 - Python: 3.11.9
 - PostgreSQL: 16.1
 - pip: 23.1.1

Install the following packages:
 - psycopg2
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - python-dotenv
 - openai
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: step 1 and 2 are optional, if you want to do them, you need to 
have an OpenAI API key.

STEP 1: Create a database in PostgreSQL with the schema specified in 
./initial_phase/create_table.sql. It is important to know the username,
password and port you are using to connect. After that, create 
a file int this directory and name it local.env and add the following 
information:


DB_HOST=yourDatabaseHost
DB_PORT=yourDatabasePort
DB_DATABASE=yourDatabaseName
DB_USER=yourDatabaseUsername
DB_PASSWORD=yourDatabasePassword
OPENAI_API_KEY=yourOpenAIKey

Once you have done that, you can run the script in 
./intial_phase/data.py to populate the database with the data
from the csv files in ./initial_phase/data.

STEP 2: Run each script in ./nlp folder to generate the data for the 
NLP model. Once you have done that, you are ready to run the jupyter 
notebook named ProductionReviewAnalysis to see the results.

STEP 3: Run the ProductionReviewAnalysis.ipynb file to see the 
results of the analysis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBS: If you want to skip step 1 and 2, you can use the 
processed_data.sql file which is a dump of the database after running
the scripts in ./initial_phase and ./nlp_phase folders. You can import 
this file to your database and run the ProductionReviewAnalysis.ipynb 
file to see the results of the analysis.Remember to create the
local.env file with the required information to connect to the 
database - you don't need the OPENAI_API_KEY in this case.
