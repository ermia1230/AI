975,"The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.",3,True,False,4
984,"The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.",1,False,True,4
984,"This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!",3,True,True,4

984,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",1,False,True,4
984,"I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon",1,False,True,3
984,"I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.",1,False,True,4
975,"I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter, thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing, more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.",3,False,True,4
964,"I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves, however, ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts, no fitted places, nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned, it sprea",2,False,True,4
975,"1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.

2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.

3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.

4. very polyester with lots of static.

974,"When i saw this jacket in store, i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",2,False,True,4
974,"This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.

the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i",2,False,True,4

975,"Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt, made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly, air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.",3,False,True,4

974,"The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans, black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.",3,False,True,2
964,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me, it's not true at all, i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable, but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website, it's more like 18""), which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",2,False,True,1

975,"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

975,"I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too",3,False,True,4
975,"I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.",2,False,True,4

984,"I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t",2,False,True,4

975,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut, but unfortunately, the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily, and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store, and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it, but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",3,False,True,2

975,"I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss, copper and burgundy. they are soft, well-fitting, pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material, and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better, but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials, this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.",2,False,True,4
984,"Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons, checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down, that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!",3,True,True,4

984,"First, the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket, with its crisply cut lapels
and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the
cool watch pocket), the size of the buttons, the color. i got the honey,
and it was lovely and intense,. now, the bad:
i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's
a small, tight 8, the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to
be folded, and the lining which would show is not that attractive.",3,False,True,4

974,"I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style, but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design, but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.",2,False,True,1
974,"This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  

i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.",3,False,True,3
974,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,1,False,True,2

974,"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",1,False,True,5
974,"I bought this (because it looks beautiful, is well made, and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on, it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead, it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi",3,False,True,4

984,"I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer, and would work in an office. but, on me, the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad, the couldnt have done it better. further, the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again, not flattering",3,True,False,4
975,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,1,False,True,4

975,"I don't mind loose-fitting clothing, but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling, tying, pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes, and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body, i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings, then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed, especially since the design on the fabr",3,False,True,4

984,"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5"", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr",3,True,False,4
